          <p>
            I grew up on a small farm in the outskirts of Mexico City. I love
            the farm life, it was hard work waking up at 4 in the morning daily
            to feed the animals and get the water up and running but everyday
            was an adventure. I remember chasing chickens, being chased by
            chickens and being kicked by a bull (yes it hurt!). We immigrated to
            the US when I was 9 years old. I remember being blown away! So much
            conveniences and technology! When I found out about Disney land,
            ohhh ma gaaaad! I did my best at school and I was selected to go to
            Boston for a leadership camp at
            <a

              target="_blank"
              >Mount Herman</a
            >. I never could have imagined the journey I was set on but I can
            say that it all goes back to my farm out in Mexico and I do my best
            to try to express what I see with Art.
